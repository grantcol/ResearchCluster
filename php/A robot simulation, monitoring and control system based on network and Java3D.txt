Abstract
is connected with off-line programming module, usen can program a robot by the legible robot language off-line, and finally download the robot instructions to the controller. When the system is connected with the robot controller via network, the status of the robot can be displayed in 3D-simulation mode, and the behavior of the robot can be monitored dynamically, and the authorized user can also control the action of the robot through the network as well. This paper describes the technique and method implementing executable interactive robot 3D simulation based on the Java platform, using lava3D for 3D visualization in combination with VRML for external robot representation in detail. This system can run on any operating system that supports JVM, and realizes the concept of “Write Once, Run Anywhere”. This paper also discusses robot instruction, instruction interpreter and off- line programming, and introduces the functional actualization of the 3D graphic simulation, monitoring and control system. Fully implemented cases include using this system under linux and windows operation system, and applying to PT500 and PT600 robot.
